# rezonateR

rezonateR (pronounced "resonate R") uses R (statistics software) to analyze and visualize data about resonance in natural language. The data that rezonateR takes as input are those created by the companion tool [Rezonator](https://github.com/johnwdubois/rezonator).     
In addition, rezonateR can provide some pre-processing of natural language data to prepare them for importing into Rezonator.   
    
Resonance represents the activation of affinities across utterances in natural language. Resonance plays a key part in creating links between parallel structures, thereby inviting the perception of parallel meanings. Resonance is a key factor in the creation of coherence in dialogue, and the organization of engagement between co-participants in conversation.
